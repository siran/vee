## Roadmap
1. Onboard Android users.
2. Receive email forwards and continue conversation.

... down the road:

- We have the audio, so we can do anything we want with it:
    - extract the recipient
    - extract additional commands
        - for example manage appointments or translations



Eventually be an entrypoint for an AI-driven voice assistant.
